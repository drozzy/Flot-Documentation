Plot Methods
------------

The Plot object returned from the plot function has some methods you
can call:

  - highlight(series, datapoint)

    Highlight a specific datapoint in the data series. You can either
    specify the actual objects, e.g. if you got them from a
    "plotclick" event, or you can specify the indices, e.g.
    highlight(1, 3) to highlight the fourth point in the second series
    (remember, zero-based indexing).

  
  - unhighlight(series, datapoint) or unhighlight()

    Remove the highlighting of the point, same parameters as
    highlight.

    If you call unhighlight with no parameters, e.g. as
    plot.unhighlight(), all current highlights are removed.


  - setData(data)

    You can use this to reset the data used. Note that axis scaling,
    ticks, legend etc. will not be recomputed (use setupGrid() to do
    that). You'll probably want to call draw() afterwards.

    You can use this function to speed up redrawing a small plot if
    you know that the axes won't change. Put in the new data with
    setData(newdata), call draw(), and you're good to go. Note that
    for large datasets, almost all the time is consumed in draw()
    plotting the data so in this case don't bother.

    
  - setupGrid()

    Recalculate and set axis scaling, ticks, legend etc.

    Note that because of the drawing model of the canvas, this
    function will immediately redraw (actually reinsert in the DOM)
    the labels and the legend, but not the actual tick lines because
    they're drawn on the canvas. You need to call draw() to get the
    canvas redrawn.
    
  - draw()

    Redraws the plot canvas.

  - triggerRedrawOverlay()

    Schedules an update of an overlay canvas used for drawing
    interactive things like a selection and point highlights. This
    is mostly useful for writing plugins. The redraw doesn't happen
    immediately, instead a timer is set to catch multiple successive
    redraws (e.g. from a mousemove).

  - width()/height()

    Gets the width and height of the plotting area inside the grid.
    This is smaller than the canvas or placeholder dimensions as some
    extra space is needed (e.g. for labels).

  - offset()

    Returns the offset of the plotting area inside the grid relative
    to the document, useful for instance for calculating mouse
    positions (event.pageX/Y minus this offset is the pixel position
    inside the plot).

  - pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos })

    Returns the calculated offset of the data point at (x, y) in data
    space within the placeholder div. If you are working with multiple axes, you
    can specify the x and y axis references, e.g. 

      o = pointOffset({ x: xpos, y: ypos, xaxis: 2, yaxis: 3 })
      // o.left and o.top now contains the offset within the div
  

There are also some members that let you peek inside the internal
workings of Flot which is useful in some cases. Note that if you change
something in the objects returned, you're changing the objects used by
Flot to keep track of its state, so be careful.

  - getData()

    Returns an array of the data series currently used in normalized
    form with missing settings filled in according to the global
    options. So for instance to find out what color Flot has assigned
    to the data series, you could do this:

      var series = plot.getData();
      for (var i = 0; i < series.length; ++i)
        alert(series[i].color);

    A notable other interesting field besides color is datapoints
    which has a field "points" with the normalized data points in a
    flat array (the field "pointsize" is the increment in the flat
    array to get to the next point so for a dataset consisting only of
    (x,y) pairs it would be 2).

  - getAxes()

    Gets an object with the axes. The axes are returned as the
    attributes of the object, so for instance getAxes().xaxis is the
    x axis.

    Various things are stuffed inside an axis object, e.g. you could
    use getAxes().xaxis.ticks to find out what the ticks are for the
    xaxis. Two other useful attributes are p2c and c2p, functions for
    transforming from data point space to the canvas plot space and
    back. Both returns values that are offset with the plot offset.
    Check the Flot source code for the complete set of attributes (or
    output an axis with console.log() and inspect it).

    With multiple axes, the extra axes are returned as x2axis, x3axis,
    etc., e.g. getAxes().y2axis is the second y axis. You can check
    y2axis.used to see whether the axis is actually in use or not. 
 
  - getPlaceholder()

    Returns placeholder that the plot was put into. This can be useful
    for plugins for adding DOM elements or firing events.

  - getCanvas()

    Returns the canvas used for drawing in case you need to hack on it
    yourself. You'll probably need to get the plot offset too.
  
  - getPlotOffset()

    Gets the offset that the grid has within the canvas as an object
    with distances from the canvas edges as "left", "right", "top",
    "bottom". I.e., if you draw a circle on the canvas with the center
    placed at (left, top), its center will be at the top-most, left
    corner of the grid.

  - getOptions()

    Gets the options for the plot, in a normalized format with default
    values filled in.
    

Hooks
=====

In addition to the public methods, the Plot object also has some hooks
that can be used to modify the plotting process. You can install a
callback function at various points in the process, the function then
gets access to the internal data structures in Flot.

Here's an overview of the phases Flot goes through:

  1. Plugin initialization, parsing options
  
  2. Constructing the canvases used for drawing

  3. Set data: parsing data specification, calculating colors,
     copying raw data points into internal format,
     normalizing them, finding max/min for axis auto-scaling

  4. Grid setup: calculating axis spacing, ticks, inserting tick
     labels, the legend

  5. Draw: drawing the grid, drawing each of the series in turn

  6. Setting up event handling for interactive features

  7. Responding to events, if any

Each hook is simply a function which is put in the appropriate array.
You can add them through the "hooks" option, and they are also available
after the plot is constructed as the "hooks" attribute on the returned
plot object, e.g.

  // define a simple draw hook
  function hellohook(plot, canvascontext) { alert("hello!"); };

  // pass it in, in an array since we might want to specify several
  var plot = $.plot(placeholder, data, { hooks: { draw: [hellohook] } });

  // we can now find it again in plot.hooks.draw[0] unless a plugin
  // has added other hooks

The available hooks are described below. All hook callbacks get the
plot object as first parameter. You can find some examples of defined
hooks in the plugins bundled with Flot.

 - processOptions  [phase 1]

   function(plot, options)
   
   Called after Flot has parsed and merged options. Useful in the
   instance where customizations beyond simple merging of default
   values is needed. A plugin might use it to detect that it has been
   enabled and then turn on or off other options.

 
 - processRawData  [phase 3]

   function(plot, series, data, datapoints)
 
   Called before Flot copies and normalizes the raw data for the given
   series. If the function fills in datapoints.points with normalized
   points and sets datapoints.pointsize to the size of the points,
   Flot will skip the copying/normalization step for this series.
   
   In any case, you might be interested in setting datapoints.format,
   an array of objects for specifying how a point is normalized and
   how it interferes with axis scaling.

   The default format array for points is something along the lines of:

     [
       { x: true, number: true, required: true },
       { y: true, number: true, required: true }
     ]

   The first object means that for the first coordinate it should be
   taken into account when scaling the x axis, that it must be a
   number, and that it is required - so if it is null or cannot be
   converted to a number, the whole point will be zeroed out with
   nulls. Beyond these you can also specify "defaultValue", a value to
   use if the coordinate is null. This is for instance handy for bars
   where one can omit the third coordinate (the bottom of the bar)
   which then defaults to 0.


 - processDatapoints  [phase 3]

   function(plot, series, datapoints)
 
   Called after normalization of the given series but before finding
   min/max of the data points. This hook is useful for implementing data
   transformations. "datapoints" contains the normalized data points in
   a flat array as datapoints.points with the size of a single point
   given in datapoints.pointsize. Here's a simple transform that
   multiplies all y coordinates by 2:

     function multiply(plot, series, datapoints) {
         var points = datapoints.points, ps = datapoints.pointsize;
         for (var i = 0; i < points.length; i += ps)
             points[i + 1] *= 2;
     }

   Note that you must leave datapoints in a good condition as Flot
   doesn't check it or do any normalization on it afterwards.


 - drawSeries  [phase 5]

   function(plot, canvascontext, series)

   Hook for custom drawing of a single series. Called just before the
   standard drawing routine has been called in the loop that draws
   each series.
   
 
 - draw  [phase 5]

   function(plot, canvascontext)
 
   Hook for drawing on the canvas. Called after the grid is drawn
   (unless it's disabled or grid.aboveData is set) and the series have
   been plotted (in case any points, lines or bars have been turned
   on). For examples of how to draw things, look at the source code.
   
 
 - bindEvents  [phase 6]

   function(plot, eventHolder)

   Called after Flot has setup its event handlers. Should set any
   necessary event handlers on eventHolder, a jQuery object with the
   canvas, e.g.

     function (plot, eventHolder) {
         eventHolder.mousedown(function (e) {
             alert("You pressed the mouse at " + e.pageX + " " + e.pageY);
         });
     }

   Interesting events include click, mousemove, mouseup/down. You can
   use all jQuery events. Usually, the event handlers will update the
   state by drawing something (add a drawOverlay hook and call
   triggerRedrawOverlay) or firing an externally visible event for
   user code. See the crosshair plugin for an example.
     
   Currently, eventHolder actually contains both the static canvas
   used for the plot itself and the overlay canvas used for
   interactive features because some versions of IE get the stacking
   order wrong. The hook only gets one event, though (either for the
   overlay or for the static canvas).

   Note that custom plot events generated by Flot are not generated on
   eventHolder, but on the div placeholder supplied as the first
   argument to the plot call. You can get that with
   plot.getPlaceholder() - that's probably also the one you should use
   if you need to fire a custom event.


 - drawOverlay  [phase 7]

   function (plot, canvascontext)

   The drawOverlay hook is used for interactive things that need a
   canvas to draw on. The model currently used by Flot works the way
   that an extra overlay canvas is positioned on top of the static
   canvas. This overlay is cleared and then completely redrawn
   whenever something interesting happens. This hook is called when
   the overlay canvas is to be redrawn.

   "canvascontext" is the 2D context of the overlay canvas. You can
   use this to draw things. You'll most likely need some of the
   metrics computed by Flot, e.g. plot.width()/plot.height(). See the
   crosshair plugin for an example.
