Plugins
-------

Plugins extend the functionality of Flot. To use a plugin, simply
include its Javascript file after Flot in the HTML page.

If you're worried about download size/latency, you can concatenate all
the plugins you use, and Flot itself for that matter, into one big file
(make sure you get the order right), then optionally run it through a
Javascript minifier such as YUI Compressor.

Here's a brief explanation of how the plugin plumbings work:

Each plugin registers itself in the global array $.plot.plugins. When
you make a new plot object with $.plot, Flot goes through this array
calling the "init" function of each plugin and merging default options
from its "option" attribute. The init function gets a reference to the
plot object created and uses this to register hooks and add new public
methods if needed.

See the PLUGINS.txt file for details on how to write a plugin. As the
above description hints, it's actually pretty easy.
